Here we have our repository for our project studying how the establishment of a casino in a city affects many aspects of said city.
In Ethan's Folder we have the code for first part of the presentation where he collects park data from each of the cities we selected
and compares the data to nearby cities. He also creates a map visual that portrays where the cities we selected are in the country
In Trevor's Folder we have code collecting crime data from each city csv as well as adjusting the crime rates to be per 1000 residents 
in the city. In both python files there is a t-test to determine significance within the data. In the data-storage folder we have the csvs
containing crime rates for each individual city as well as merged and total US data.
